# AI-for-images: A Comprehensive Study on Computer Vision
Welcome to the AI-for-images repository! This repository is dedicated to the in-depth study and implementation of the three main branches of computer vision:

1. Image Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Image Segmentation

## Repository Structure
### 1. Image Classification
Overview: Image classification is the process of assigning a label to an input image from a predefined set of categories.
Contents:
Datasets: Links to popular datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST.
Models: Implementations of various image classification models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ResNet, and VGG.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the training, evaluation, and deployment of classification models.
### 2. Object Detection
Overview: Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image. Unlike image classification, it provides both the category and the bounding box coordinates for each object.
Contents:
Datasets: Resources for datasets like COCO, PASCAL VOC, and Open Images.
Models: Implementations of popular object detection algorithms including YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN.
Notebooks: Step-by-step tutorials and experiments on training object detection models and evaluating their performance.
### 3. Image Segmentation
Overview: Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, often used to locate objects and boundaries within images.
Contents:
Datasets: Access to datasets like ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff.
Models: Implementations of segmentation models such as U-Net, Mask R-CNN, and DeepLab.
Notebooks: Comprehensive guides on segmenting images, training segmentation models, and analyzing their results.
