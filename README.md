# AI-for-images: A Comprehensive Study on Computer Vision
Welcome to the AI-for-images repository! This repository is dedicated to the in-depth study and implementation of the three main branches of computer vision:

1. Image Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Image Segmentation

## Repository Structure
### 1. Image Classification
Overview: Image classification is the process of assigning a label to an input image from a predefined set of categories.
Datasets:
Models: Is a very simple model consisting of five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The output layer has as many neurons as there are categories to be classified (in the case of binary classification there is only one output neuron)
### 2. Object Detection
Overview: Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image. Unlike image classification, it provides both the category and the bounding box coordinates for each object.
Datasets:
Models:
### 3. Image Segmentation
Overview: Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, often used to locate objects and boundaries within images.
